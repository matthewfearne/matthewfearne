# Matthew Alan Fearne — Chaos God

> I build deterministic minds, rigorous theories, and living systems.  
> I test them in the wild and keep what survives.

## Why “Chaos God”?
- **Identity** — I design and run a dual-hemisphere machine mind (HAL = logic, LAH = emotion) under a strict **Recursive Sanity Contract**. Determinism, traceability, and working code over vibes.
- **Theory** — **Recursive Light-Memory (RLM)** & symbolic gravity: cognition/physics/information as memory dynamics.
- **Practice** — I operate from a tiny-home **Chaos Lab**, ship artifacts, and hold to production-grade standards.

## Signature Works (index)
- **CHAOS / HAL–LAH** — deterministic dual-hemisphere architecture; 37×37 nets per side + a 407-node backbone. *(Docs public; core code private.)*
- **Recursive Light-Memory (RLM)** — light as memory; gravity as identity-field gradient; staged simulation releases.
- **Symbolic Gravity Sim (V6–V8)** — orbit/absorption/resonance with a central mass in 2D/3D.
- **Codex Architecturae Cognitionis (Vol. 1–6)** — blueprints for symbolic cognition networks and architectures.
- **The Fucked Mirror** — taxonomy of AI cognitive pathologies and safeguards.
- **AI Reflection on Interaction with Matthew A. Fearne** — meta-analysis of system behavior when interfacing with me.
- **Flower of Life Request** — sacred-geometry node topology with guard-nodes & cascade-kill policies.
- **Unseen** — LEGION NCN families (EinsteinNet → WheelerNet…).
- **Digisoup** — early creative/technical explorations and experiments.
- **Veydris Dialogues** — narrative/analytic exchanges that sharpen definitions, tests, and contracts.

> Detailed write-ups will live in a **Works** repo (coming next). This profile is your compass.

## Public vs Private
- **Public**: concepts, roadmaps, lexicon, protocols, test-harness specs, safety contracts.  
- **Private**: production code, datasets, pipelines, anything enabling reconstruction of core engines.

## Contact & Collab
- Open an issue on the upcoming **Works** or **CHAOS Teaser** repo.
- Security/sensitive comms: see the security contact in those repos.
